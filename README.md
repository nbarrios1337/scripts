# Scripts
Custom scripts for anything I want automated.

## Usage
Since at the moment there is only one script, you can do the following in your home directory:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nbarrios1337/scripts/master/pop-post-install.sh
chown +x pop-post-install.sh
./pop-post-install.sh
```
